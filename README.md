# Facundo L. Rodríguez

Cybersecurity. System programming. The art of breaking and building. As a Computer Science student at UBA, I'm on a mission to master the depths of low-level programming and digital security. Every system has vulnerabilities—some to exploit, others to reinforce. I want to understand both.

## Vision

The digital world runs on trust. But trust is fragile. My focus is on system architecture and cybersecurity—learning how to build resilient software while uncovering the weaknesses that others miss. This isn't just about writing code; it's about understanding the foundations that hold everything together.

I'm not here to follow the path—I'm here to carve my own. If you're building something ambitious, securing critical infrastructure, or just looking to push boundaries, let's talk.
